# Final Assessment ‚Äì SQL Module 2 with Sakila Database (Adalab)

This repository contains the solutions for the final assessment of Module 2, using the **Sakila** relational database. The project includes 24 real-world SQL exercises, covering key skills expected in data and backend roles.

---

## üí° Description

This project demonstrates hands-on SQL capabilities that are highly valued by companies in the fields of data analytics, business intelligence, and backend development:

- **Subqueries**, including correlated subqueries
- **JOIN optimization** (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`)
- Use of **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** for modular queries
- **REGEXP** for pattern extraction and string filtering
- Aggregation functions (`AVG`, `COUNT`, `SUM`) and advanced filtering

üìù The SQL script includes in-line comments (using `#`) to explain the logic and decision-making behind each query. These annotations serve to demonstrate technical knowledge and provide clear reasoning for each solution.

## üìå Sample Queries

> ‚ú® This README includes selected SQL examples to demonstrate real-world use of advanced techniques like CTEs, subqueries, REGEXP, and optimized JOINs, aligned with technical competencies frequently assessed in professional data and backend interviews.

### üîÅ Correlated Subquery

Identify customers who spent more than the average across all customers:

```sql
SELECT cus.first_name, cus.last_name, SUM(p.amount) AS total_spent
FROM customer cus
JOIN payment p ON cus.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY cus.customer_id
HAVING total_spent > (
    SELECT AVG(customer_total)
    FROM (
        SELECT SUM(p2.amount) AS customer_total
        FROM payment p2
        GROUP BY p2.customer_id
    ) sub
);
```

### üîé REGEXP for Pattern Matching

Retrieve movies with descriptions containing the word "amazing":

```sql
SELECT title, description
FROM film 
WHERE description REGEXP 'amazing';
```

### üß± CTE to Exclude Actors from a Specific Category

Find actors who **have not acted** in any "Horror" movies:

```sql
WITH horror_actors AS (
    SELECT actor_id
    FROM actor
    JOIN film_actor USING (actor_id)
    JOIN film USING (film_id)
    JOIN film_category USING (film_id)
    JOIN category USING (category_id)
    WHERE category.name = 'Horror'
    GROUP BY actor_id
)
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE actor_id NOT IN (SELECT actor_id FROM horror_actors);
```

### ü§ù Optimized JOINs

Retrieve the number of movies rented per customer, including names:

```sql
SELECT cus.first_name, cus.last_name, COUNT(ren.inventory_id) AS total_rentals
FROM rental ren
INNER JOIN customer cus USING (customer_id)
GROUP BY cus.customer_id, cus.first_name, cus.last_name;
```
